## üîß Configuration

### API Connection
The app connects to Forknet Core at `http://localhost:10391`. Admin features require an API key that Forknet Core generates automatically.

### Auto-refresh Settings
- **Default**: 30-second refresh intervals
- **Customizable**: 10 seconds to 5 minutes
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects node restarts

### Security Settings
- **Private Key Protection**: Multi-step access with warnings
- **Backup Encryption**: AES-256 encryption with user passwords
- **Session Management**: Automatic logout on app close

## Development

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19.1.0 with TypeScript
- **UI Framework**: Material-UI 7.1.0
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **Desktop**: Electron 28.3.3
- **Routing**: React Router 7.x (HashRouter for Electron compatibility)
- **Cryptography**: Noble curves/hashes (Forknet-compatible)
- **Build Tools**: Create React App, Electron Builder

### Development Scripts
```bash
# Development mode
npm start                 # Web version (limited functionality)
npm run electron-dev      # Electron development with hot reload

# Building
npm run build            # Web build
npm run build-electron   # Desktop app for current platform
npm run build-electron-all  # All platforms (requires setup)

# Analysis
npm run analyze          # Bundle size analysis
npm test                 # Run tests
```

### API Integration
The application connects to Forknet Core API running on `http://localhost:10391`. Admin features require an API key automatically generated by Forknet Core at `~/forknet-core/apikey.txt`.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No API key found"**
- Ensure Forknet Core is running and has generated `~/forknet-core/apikey.txt`

**"Connection refused"**
- Check that Forknet Core is running on `localhost:10391`
- Verify firewall settings

**"Invalid backup file"**
- Ensure you're using a valid Forknet backup JSON file
- Check that you have the correct password

**"Application entry file not found" during build**
- Make sure you're using `npm run build-electron` instead of `npm run dist`
- Verify that `electron-is-dev` is in dependencies (not devDependencies)

**"404 Page Not Found" when opening desktop app**
- This indicates a routing issue - the app should use HashRouter for Electron compatibility
- Try rebuilding with `npm run build-electron`

**"Cannot find module 'electron-is-dev'" error**
- Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are properly installed
- Check that `electron-is-dev` is listed in dependencies in package.json
